I’m playing video games since almost 30 years now and it became recently very hard to find a game to really impress me and give me the feeling of being kind of addicted.. this one did. Started at the day of official release and I’m hooked since day one. The community at Discord is just great. They really help you out with every question and are open to play together to get you in. This is not a mainstream type of game like CoD or Battlefield, it doesn’t even try. My biggest concern was the “forced” Voice over IP, but it even turned out to be one of the biggest highlights of the game. The immersion is just insane when you hear your team members scream for a medic while the artillery is bombing all over you.. you can hear the voices of your team members according to the directions where they are located.

However, none of that really matters, a month later? Who fricking cares, yes I had some of it spoiled, but I should have kept away from the batman forums to be sure. Still the story keeps me intrigued, the combat is insanely good, and the atmosphere is amazing. Can't do much about GFWL and SecuRom, they don't make the game worse, they are just bad choiced to safeguard against people playing without paying. The DX11 thing is something that they already are aware of, and they will fix it. So, if your that angered by it, wait before you buy it, or if you already bought it, don't play until the patch is out. Until that patch there are lots of goodies to play meanwhile, like Skyrim and Battlefield 3.As stated earlier this games combat is awesome, and works even better on mouse and keyboard than its predecessor. I have had no troubles whatsoever, and the troubles I did have came from me not being used to the combat system, not because it was bad.The graphics are gorgeous beyond belief, even in DX9 it looks good, I can also run at almost max with max PhysX on my GTX460, only thing I have turned down is AA at 16x .The sound is awesome, including the voice acting, The Joker is especially, like last game, really good. But most all of the voice acting done here is awesome.I can't find any fault with this game other than the DX11 problem, and that will be fixed, so a solid 10/10 and this game leaves me wondering what will be GOTY.

The dialogue is incredibly charming and tells a story about complicated feelings so elegantly and with so much honesty (I mean, you can feel it through the dialogue). The gameplay is incredibly fluid and its difficulty curve is perfect (However, I am a platformer afficiando, so take that with a grain of salt). I mean, seriously. Just jumping around and dashing in an empty space feels amazing, and there are so many collectibles to find using these amazing controls! You can choose to play on assist mode, or complete the game 100% and have an outstanding time no matter what. This game simply gets everything right: from skippable cutscenes to counters that help see what you missed in a level. The B-sides are just as fun as the main story and there's secrets hiding in every corner.

55,Europa Universalis IV,13-Aug-13,"WOW! For about ten years Paradox Development have been a small team of nice guys working hard to give us good games and mostly failing. Their games have been for the most part tedious, pretentious and ugly, with cluttered mechanisms, and hideous micromanagement. Most of the Paradox efforts suffered from terrible tutorials and ridiculous learning curved that discouraged any vaguely casual gamers. But beyond inaccessibility, the games were finally not that good, because even when you figured out the mechanisms they were still too MECHANICAL: not even really worth learning in the end because they were all variations of a sausage machine. However something miraculous happened with Crusaders Kings 2, and echoes of the good things we saw in earlier games (Hearts of Iron 2) reappeared: Better looking graphics. Simpler, yet DEEPER gameplay.  The machine kept churning away but Paradox learned to save us from the worst of it, and the gameplay began to blossom. Europa Universalis IV seems to demonstrate that Paradox has really turned the corner. The game is beautiful.  Gameplay is fluid. The depth and complication is welcome, but it has been softened with a more thoughtful and gaming friendly structure! GREAT WORK PARADOX! Good things take time, and your grand ambitions are finally bearing fruit. I'm very excited about where this will lead with the Hearts of Iron series, because all the design wisdom that we can see in CK2 and EU4 is leading in the absolute correct direction. If you love strategy gaming please go and buy this game and support this developer! This is a FAR, FAR superior game to Civilizations 1-5 as well as anything put out by Creative Assembly. It's been a long wait but worth it. Can't wait to see what we get when the final few pieces of the game design puzzle fall into place. If they get the budget to build something with a more solid multiplayer experience we will see the PERFECT game.",87,8.7

The devs no doubt achieved what they set out to do, and I applaud them for that. I only wish I had a little more time with it all. Perhaps a sequel is in order?

I'm not a lover of platformer games, but this game gave me only positive emotions (except the final boss who is INSANELY annoying). For example, I can admit some things what was perfect in the game: - Music, this techno and metal mix is a masterpiece. Especially according to what happening on a screen.- Pixel art style, could look too simple. But this simpleness is genius. It is a difficult game that makes us replay again and again a single location, but your eyes never get tired of it. The only minus here is bugs. You can easily get stuck under textures. Sometimes after a completed mission, it freezes and you can't quit the menu. After few times, it starts getting annoying.I'm satisfied with every single minute I have spent here and definitely recommend you to check this game out.",85,8.2

Pagodawest, Headcanon and Christian whitehead did an amazing job of balancing the gameplay and gathering the memorable stages, bosses, gimmicks that we all loved in the 16 bit sonic era and put their own signature names on it. Sonic Mania is not only a celebration for Sonic fans but also to SEGA fans. This game is filled with Easter eggs and homages to what made SEGA beloved. Sonic Mania should be celebrated by all gamers not only because it's a very good game but also because it opens a new chapter in the gaming industry that companies like Valve used to practice and companies like Nintendo should be more lenient about (AM2R).",84,7.7
116,Speed Brawl,18-Sep-18,"An anime-inspired brawler has entered the gaming scene and Double Stallion Games has developed a stylish combat-racer. Speed Brawl is a 2D combat-racer, a game that will certainly thrill the player if they already love all things speed and throwing a good punch. This is a game that meets you where you’re at; whether you enjoy a competitive play or are looking for something casual, Speed Brawl offers what you like and much more. The typical level design in Speed Brawl involves a standard championship, made up of three races. Your performance is measured by how quickly you can defeat all enemies and cross the finish line. Combat is the cherry on top in Speed Brawl and is a wonderful sight to watch as you dash and attack your enemies, and cleverly time your ultimate attacks to unleash your brawler into a frenzy of power. But behind every punch is a strategy, and Speed Brawl rewards the player who takes their time to assess the playground and carefully think through their plays. For example, certain Selenites have weak spots such as their backs or above their head, which took me several brawls to figure out. Dashing against walls and poles allow you to quickly reach your opponents from a distance, and counter-attacks can be crucial in avoiding an instant K.O. There are open windows to watch out for during your brawl, like a quick flash from a Selenite which indicates they’re about to attack you. This is a perfect hint for you to block or counter-attack, but the timing of your desired move is important. Even if you had an intended play, Speed Brawl quickly notes that speed is not only important on the field, but in your reflexes too. Speed Brawl is a stylish combat-racer that provides plenty of punch, kick, and personality. Its setting offers unique playgrounds for players to brawl and test their skills to the limit, making Speed Brawl one of the most fun games I’ve played this year. With enough brawlers to select and combine as a tag team, and new enemies to overcome, Speed Brawl offers many incentives for players to stick to the fight, enticing you with customization and rewards. Though the rewards can feel a little repetitive and unfair, the challenge that Speed Brawl poses gives enough motivation to either claim a gold trophy in your next race or customize your brawler further with set skill traits, appearance changes, and new gear.",No Score,tbd

122,Stubbs the Zombie in Rebel Without a Pulse,21-Nov-05,"Guaranteed to turn some heads, this third-person action game is an original IP by Bungie Studio veterans that uses an updated Halo engine to deliver a stirring tale of one man's hunger for love, justice...and brains. In this game, players take on the role of the rebel himself ? Stubbs, a wisecracking Zombie who takes on an ultra-modern city of the future using nothing but his own carcass and the weapons of his possessed enemies. The game?s tongue-in-cheek humor, innovative combat and strong storyline keep Stubbs the Zombie?s gameplay as bizarre and unpredictable as its namesake. On his quest, Stubbs lurches his way through numerous large and visually captivating indoor/outdoor environments in and around the gleaming city of Punchbowl, PA, a city built during the Eisenhower administration to show off the ultra-futuristic technology of the 21st century.

His enemies have shotguns, tanks, and all manner of futuristic weaponry.  All Stubbs has is his own rotting corpse, a distinct lack of pain or conscience, and the ability to turn foes into zombie allies.

125,Sunless Sea,1-Jul-14,"One of my favourite games of all time. It's famously harsh and keen to kill you, which is part of the dark humour. It's a humour style that won't work for everyone, but if you recognise and appreciate their references then it'll reward you in spades. Strongly recommend getting the Zubmariner DLC too - it's playable inside the main game story, and gives you many advantages once you've gained the ability to scour the surface, the Unterzee and the sea bed too. The game also makes a big deal about playing for permadeath, teasing the idea that it would be detrimental to use Saves and lose your status as a ""true"" player. I'd advise you to forget that, and use the Save! It's hard enough without completely crushing yourself. Abandon all ideas about finding some cheap stock that's worth a fortune at another port, too; such things are almost totally non-existent, and this isn't Elite. Money will appear as windfalls from unexpected moments in the game's story, as will life-saving food and fuel (although you will also need to buy these!).  The game wants you to forget about traditional game ideas and put both feet into being a foolhardy sea captain from a horror story.

152,Yoku's Island Express,29-May-18,"What a delightful little game. The seemingly nutty idea of mixing pinball and metroidvania works surprisingly well. And the overall design of the game matches in terms of nuttiness. It's all so charming. Characters in the game will e.g. dive by lettings themselves get partly swallowed by fish and then the fish pulls them under water. Or climb by having animals bite plants and then swing around them - it's best to watch a video if you can't imagine this. And I still remember the very first couple of minutes gameplay when the logo of the game appears - I for one had to chuckle at the way that was presented. But not only does it ooze charm but it also handles very well. Pinball mechanics may not be particularly realistic but hey... you're playing with a beetle strapped to a ball. The important point is that it feels alright. And traversing the (huge!) map works a lot faster than one would initially expect because of all sorts of shortcuts and additional methods of transportation one eventually unlocks. Somewhere I read a comment that it can be annoying to go upwards since obviously the ball only falls down. But there are all sorts of flippers and lanes that fling/move you upwards, so I've never found this to be an issue. Oh and the map might just be one of the best I've ever seen - it simply zooms out the game so that you can see the whole world (although some things don't seem to update properly at times - a bit buggy). but you can also zoom in and pan around. The only flaw I've found is that it does feel very much like a children's game in that it's very easy. I've played quite a bit of Pinball FX and Pro Pinball and there hasn't really been any challenge. So I'm really just exploring and having fun discovering all those different biomes and new characters and quests. Of which there are many. It's like every couple of minutes that you come across some NPC to chat with. Still - most of the time, I run around with maxed out fruits and I wonder whether they couldn't have included some aspect where if you play well (which reminds me - there is no combo system, no time limits and all shots are easy to pull off), you get something - once fruit is maxed out, symbols change to something else and do... whatever. Or something. And since I know that length matters to people with limited finances - it took me about 7 hours to finish regularly (although I did many side quests and whatnot) and after about 10 hours, I'm at 97% and saw the ""true ending"".

By experience most developers from Eastern Europe always care a lot for a unique style, story and atmosphere and luckily I was not disappointed.

155,A Good Snowman Is Hard To Build,25-Feb-15,"What is ""A Good Snowman is Hard to Build?"" you ask? It's a puzzle game with a simplistic premise-build snowman. Each level requires 1-3 snowmen to be built in it. Each snowman consists of three snowballs (large, medium, and small) and there is snow on the ground in certain areas that increase the size of your snowballs as you roll through them. The challenge comes from how to position your snowballs so they don't become too big. It's a simplistic premise that is challenging in execution. Mechanically you can rewind a step or restart the level in an instant which you will need as there is a lot of trial and error as you figure out the proper order of the steps you need to take. The visuals are much the same as the gameplay-simplistic yet beautiful. The atmosphere is a wonderful blend of melancholy and joy. The snowmen you build have names and distinct appearances and your main character is a silent monster that really just looks like a black jujube with arms and legs. It's a great puzzle game with a great world that warms your heart as you trudge through cyber snow. I would highly recommend this game to anybody who likes puzzles.",No Score,8.6

157,Along the Edge,14-Jun-16,"Nova-Box had gotten me interested in their style of visual novels with Seer’s Isle although it didn’t fully give me what I wanted and fell short in some ways. I decided to work my way back and try Along the Edge which was their initial offering and had gotten quite a bit of praise. I will say I enjoyed it more than Seer’s Isle but some of the gripes I had remained. I’ll start by saying the art is simply fantastic and among the best I have ever seen. It almost has the style of a water color painting to it. The story was also really enjoyable and there are a good amount of choices you can make in it. Like in Seer’s Isle though the choices are tied to a set of symbols that are in no way explained to me. I have no idea which symbol a specific answer will give me nor what that means in the grand scheme of things. I simply stopped trying to guess and just picked which choices appealed to me without trying to think where they would lead. The ending I received was called “heart of darkness” due to the symbols most associated with my choices but as ominous as that sounds I wouldn’t call it a bleak ending at all. Symbols aside I enjoyed the characters; the story; the dialogue; so I advise those thinking the choice system is weird to just roll with it and enjoy the game as a whole. I did feel the game ended rather suddenly and felt a tad rushed in the last act. I also wish there were more options for romance as I didn’t care much for the ones provided but that being said staying single was an option so that’s good enough. The music is nice but gets repetitive after a while. There is no voice acting, which is fine by me, I’m just setting expectations. I played Along the Edge on Linux. The game had some issues crashing at launch on it’s old Electron based engine so the developers took the time and effort to move the game to Unity. It never crashed on me after that. I didn’t notice any spelling errors. The game uses the OpenGL API. I played version 2.0 of the game. It uses an auto save system where the game saves each time you move to the next page. This means no going back to redo a choice. My main issue with this is if you want to see where a different path leads you have to replay the entire game. I get wanting to give your choices more impact and have you put thought into them but for those who like to experiment it’s a nuisance. Alt-Tab didn’t work. Disk Space Used: 771MBGame Engine: UnityInput Used: Keyboard and Mouse GPU Usage: 0-55 %VRAM Usage: 510-1113 MBCPU Usage: 2-6 %RAM Usage: 2.6-2.7 GB Overall I found this to be a very mature visual novel with a great story to explore and some fantastic art. As much as it seems like I knock their choice system I will say kudos to the developers for trying to do something different.  I also think they should be praised for their response to their games crashing on Linux. Switching your games over to a new engine is no small feat and is a very classy move. I finished Along the Edge in 2 hours and paid $15.08 for it. I think it provided solid value for the price. My Score: 8/10 My System: AMD Ryzen 5 2600X | 16GB DDR4-3000 CL15 | MSI RX 5700 XT Gaming X 8GB | Mesa 20.1.7 | Samsung 970 Evo Plus 500GB | Manjaro 20.1 | Mate 1.24.1 | Kernel 5.8.6-1-MANJARO",No Score,tbd

Also, even though i loved the idea of having a story based around the blending of a bunch of well known fantasy characters/tropes, the actual story ending up being incredibly cheesy at times.

However, you can enroll a new crew for free and again and again.  Later, you could learn to survive your crew, earning money and obtaining more intel, then building a new plane and arming your crew.  Also, your crew could learn some tricks.Even for the difficulty, the game is quite simple. I am seasoned with flight simulators. Its not a flight simulator so learning is quite easy.  Later, you should learn some tricks such as the altitude, tracking new routes and so on. My main complain is repetitive but other that, is the DARK SOUL of the bomber games.  I repeat, its not for everybody.  If you aren't good for multitasking, then its not your game.

There's a simple map with the stages spread for you to unlock. The in-level screen is just you, the gap, and some elements to build with. There's no 'engineering lingo' to get you confused, nor any numbers (weight etc) except for the price of your building blocks and your funds limit. It's never about 'fitting the budget' as much as playing around with the designs, which is great. I had fun testing the designs, even (or especially) when they failed.

The game play is focused on deck building as well as playing the combined card/board game, and the storyline is available in co-op. Before each map, you select a deck of cards that you can freely put together from your card collection. As you progress through the game you gain more and more cards to chose from, enabling you to put together more innovative combination. Each card played will influence the happening on the game board. You might put a new ironclad in play, give it better inventory or move it a lane down. Different maps have different objectives, and you will have to find the right deck to defeat each challenge. The story is cute and humorous, but personally I would have liked to see a darker take on robots in the American Civil War. The game offers the full campaign in co-op mode, which worked smoothly and unproblematic when I played it. There are cool, rewarding boss fights which will require you to think outside the box and the missions never get repetitive. The replay value is limited, since you'd be facing the same challenges, probably solving them with the same decks. There are some challenges (which unlock cards) that require you to do things for instance with certain types of decks though, but once that is done, there's no real need to play the map again. All in all a fun game, with an inspired rule set and a story and setting you don't see too often.",69,7.2

El juego es corto, deberás pasar 2 etapas por ""mundo"" y luego enfrentarte al Jotun jefe de la zona, a excepción del primer jefe que solo tiene 1 etapa. Las etapas en general no tienen enemigos, pero si puedes encontrar ciertos peligros que te pueden matar, como asaltos de gigantescos monstruos, o verte en un entorno totalmente hostil. La finalidad de recorrer estas etapas es la de encontrar la Runa que permitirá abrir la puerta para poder enfrentarte al Jotun y además se enfoca en poder explorar la zona para encontrar bendiciones de los Dioses (poderes) y las manzanas de Idunn que te aumentarán la vida total.Ahora bien, los escenarios poseen puzzles simples, pero entretenidos y el apartado visual del juego junto con la Música van muy a tono, entregándo una gran experiencia para el jugador. El otro punto fuerte (y que tenía que serlo) es la de los jotun, tanto su diseño como la forma en la que tendrás que combatirlos es simplemente épica, aunque la mecánica de pelea es super simple, deberás esforzarte bastante para poder derrotarlos (hubo un Jotun en particular que me costó muchísimo). Una vez que hayas derrotado a los 5 Jotun, deberás verte cara a cara contra un Dios y así ganarte tu lugar en el valhalla y que tambíen es una pelea un tanto exigente, hasta que pude finalmente dar con la mejor forma de encararlo.En resumen, es un juego entretenido, corto, enfocado en explorar y enfrentar Bosses, con un bello apartado visual, excelente animación y música, además los personajes hablan en un idioma escandinavo (no reconozco cual es), pero que debo recomendar principalmente a quienes conozcan un poco de la mitología nórdica, porque si no sabes nada de nada, muchas cosas no signifcarán nada para ti, en cambio yo por ejemplo disfrute DEMASIADO, ver plasmado a una especie de Surt el jotun de fuego por ejepmplo, o ser atacado por la serpiente Jörmundgander, o ver Ratatösk y a Níðhöggr, recorrer el Yggdrasil, pasearme por Niðavellir o por Muspelheim. Realmente los disfrute a concho, espero que sigan saliendo más juegos ambientados en esta tan rica mitología.Que mejoraria? bueno obviamente hubiese sido mejor haber tenido 10 bosses y no 5, por decir algo, uno queda con ganas de más y mucho más, ese sería el aspecto negativo que le daría al juego. 8.8/10",79,7.1

209,Kingsway,18-Jul-17,"If for some reason you feel reminiscent of the Windows 95 OS, you should probably play this game. After Kingsway, I am proud to say that I was lucky enough to be born during a time when Windows 95 reigned supreme. I don’t remember much other than the ridiculously hideous UI with the solid grey taskbar and borders. Playing made me want to change my desktop theme to match it and when I did, I absolutely hated it. Andrew Morrish, creator of Super Puzzle Platformer, and Adult Swim published Kingsway as a means for us to all remember why we hated early Windows OS (Some of us still hate current OS, thanks Microsoft). This rogue-like takes the player into the a fantasy world, where you are trying to save it from a world-eating monster.You start the game by creating a character and using generic classes that give different stat bonuses. Warriors start with high strength while mages start with high intelligence and so on. I was pleasantly surprised by how hilarious the characters ended up looking when I clicked random; the names also turned out so great that I never wanted to change them. I never ended up diving into the character creation because I ended up using whatever the game generated for me. When you’re done creating your character, you are introduced to a rendition of an early 90s Windows desktop. There are a couple of windows open and a couple of desktop shortcuts. You have to manually click on the windows to bring them up to view and anything that you’re clicking will have screen priority. This makes it so that having all the windows open is advantageous, but it can cause you to misclick onto the wrong window.Clicking on the world shortcut will open an overworld map that you use to traverse the land. Moving to a destination is simple, you click on a location and depending on the distance, a meter with a time duration appears. During the allotted travel duration, you can be attacked by various enemies spanning from skeletons wielding swords to sorcerers. Battle windows pop up for each enemy you encounter and sometimes you are met with more than one enemy which means more windows to manage. Kingsway masterfully integrates an Active Time Battle system with multi-management. Certain enemies are able to create more pop-up windows that can be interacted with, an example is the a sorcerer can summon 3 icicles that fall from the top of the screen to the bottom. The player has to multitask attacking/blocking the attacks from the sorcerer while clicking the large AVOID buttons on the windows of the icicles. Many of the enemies have different effects on the player other than status effects or damage. Phantoms, a ghost-like creature, can close certain windows after their attack connects while another enemy will throw poison daggers that must be avoided before they reach the end of the screen. The depth of the combat is both simple and intuitive. Controlling the multiple windows requires precision and each misstep can lead to detrimental effects on the current adventure. I found myself fully immersed in the simple combat. Clicking and prioritizing windows felt fun and interactive. I’ve played many games with a similar active time battle and yet I felt the most involved for Kingsway’s combat. The explosion of pop-up windows and the different desktop effects leads to a different experience through each playthrough.Kingsway is a reminiscent game of a past era. The look and the feel of the game only add to the experience. Although the game lacks a story, it is made to push the player to try new things. It may take time, but reaching the end is achievable. The gameplay is where the game really shines. It was fun to manage each window that would appear; I enjoyed each individual challenge that every enemy presented. The point-and-click adventure part of the game was secondary to the fluid combat system. Experimenting with classes lead to different outcomes and it felt like I learned something through each character. The generic upgrade system per character death is something found in many other rogue-likes. The atmosphere and the aesthetics of the game really drive it home for me. If you’re looking for a game that reminds you of the Windows OS glory days, this is the perfect one. The controls limit the game to a mouse and keyboard and the only thing I would want more out of this game is the ability to play it on the go.",80,6.5

221,Outcast: Second Contact,14-Nov-17,"This game aged surprisingly well.Second Contact is basically 1:1 remaster of the old game. So if you played it, here are the differences:What is better: Graphics - enviromnents are very nice, characters are really average and animations are bellow average (mostly original)That is worse: Into - there was no budget to recreate intro movie in hd. So there is 2d replacement instead. It is HD, but it is lacking the charm. I sugest to check even the original on internet. Also searching for small objects can be pain because of all the aditional enviromnent details that are in the view now.What is same, but aged well: Story + writing, soundrack, voice acting, basic gameplay. Also the world feels really alive. Much more than any recent Bethesda or other game.What is same, but aged poorly: Jumping is really really bad (but not needed so often). And gunplay feels little weird and needs some getting used to. If you did not played this game before, just do yourself favour and buy it. It is awesome story based action adventure (with slight hints of rpg mechanics - it just works in reverse. You are not getting stronger, but enemies weaker. Result is the same).

You're just there on a flying ship visiting these unique worlds and collecting mostly medallions but also a bunch of other meaningless things. Once you collect enough medallions you unlock new areas in which you can collect some more medallions. Each world or level is designed in a pretty open way. Most of the areas of the level are accessible at all times the only difference is the things you need to do to fetch a selected medallion. Each world has 7 medallions placed around the world though you can only collect one at a time. Each medallion will put you at the starting location of the level so it's impossible to do certain things along the way - sort of artificially lengthens the game. Certain quest do repeat themselves between the worlds - like collecting 7 keys to unlock medallion or 100 coins though there is a lot of unique ones. The open nature of the levels combined with a bit floaty physics means you can reach certain places in variety of ways. In one way it's a cool thing as you can approach it your way. In another the wall jumping combined with double jump is not as tight as I would like it to be and you can climb certain places in a way that you should not be able to. But the game is still pretty fun.

249,Sokobond,27-Aug-13,"It's about time Metacritic listed this game! If you haven't seen Northernlion's ""Let's Look At"" for this game (it demonstrates the game much better than I could explain it), Sokobond is a puzzle game where the goal is to form a chemical compound with the elements (hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen) on the level. Each element is capable of forming a different number of bonds. You play as an atom of one of the elements, and if you move next to another element, the two elements will bond together if both have any remaining bonds. Once elements are bonded together, they start moving as one object. The difficulty comes from that if you form your molecule improperly, you may not be able to navigate around the level properly in order to form bonds with the atoms. Fortunately, each level has unlimited undos and can be reset easily, so a small mistake will not cause frustration. Upon completion, each level provides an interesting fact about the molecule you just formed. The level map plays an important role in progression in this game. Once a level is completed, the levels adjacent to the level you completed are unlocked. The game is divided into sections, and many of them introduce new mechanics. There is no order in which you must complete the levels; if you are stuck on one section, you can always attempt levels in a different section. There is an option to unlock all levels from the start, but I don't recommend using it unless you have been absolutely stumped on all of the available levels for hours. The game constantly mixes things up by providing new mechanics that add depth and complexity to the puzzles. Some levels have spaces that allow you to split bonds. Some levels have spaces that allow you to form double and triple bonds. Some levels have spaces that allow parts of your molecule to turn around corners. All of these mechanics are used in interesting ways. So far I have been talking on and on about how the game works and not about what I actually think of the game. So, what do I think of the game? I think this game is absolutely brilliant. The puzzles are quite difficult, but that makes them all the more satisfying when you solve them. There is also a huge variety in the puzzles; each puzzle is solved in a completely different way from the others. If I had to think of a complaint, it would be the lack of a level editor, but 144 puzzles is already quite a lot given the quality of the puzzles, and I don't think anybody could create puzzles as high quality as the ones created by the developers. All in all, a must-buy for any puzzle game fan.",82,7.5

253,SteamWorld Dig 2,22-Sep-17,"First off, Steamworld is an amazing universe. Image and Form have crafted it with love and humor, and I've really enjoyed my time in it. Steamworld Dig 1 and 2 were both polished game loops that were just fun. Steamworld Heist blew me away because it really was XCOM in 2D, but much cuter, funnier, and fairer. Steamworld Dig 2 is a great sequel because it improves on the first one in every way AND doesn't overstay its welcome with padding. It is concise and respects your time and skill, but has an amazing amount of replayability and collectible-hunting if desired.",85,8.4
254,STRAFE,9-May-17,"Don't believe the reviews. STRAFE has enormous potential. As a kickstarter backer, I can't say I didn't get what I paid for. I can't speak for the optimization issues, as the game runs fine for me, but they have a solid foundation for future balancing. As mentioned elsewhere, it pushes the ""Game of 1996"" look for all its worth and aesthetically, the game absolutely **** and has a pretty kickass soundtrack besides, I'm glad I sprung for that reward tier and am looking forward to getting my music. The guns feel effective and varied. My particular favorite is the disc launcher mode for the railgun, which calls to mind the Ripjack of Unreal fame. Enemies are as dumb as you'd expect from a game meant to be 21 years old, gibs fly everywhere and the ""Murderzone"" mode is pretty great as well, a wave survival mode with persistent upgrades unlocked when you reach certain point milestones. It is also immensely satisfying to successfully complete a run. I noticed by the time I had reached the forth zone that I had started trembling. STRAFE successfully captures the intensity of the 90s shooter, even if it doesn't 100% play like one. That being said, STRAFE goes so hard for capturing the feel of a 90s fps that it incorporates things I really DIDN'T like about them, namely, the blistering difficulty. You also have to look for keycards, but it's immensely downplayed from the old days. Quake 1 was hard, let's not kid ourselves. Mixing that style of gunplay with roguelike level generation should be a no-brainer, but in practice it makes the game harder then it needs to be: Quake wasn't stingy with health, armor and ammo pickups because you absolutely needed them all to succeed. STRAFE, being a roguelike, is by nature incredibly stingy with drops and punishes you for even incidental damage taken, which is incredibly hard to avoid in a game like this. It looks and feels like Quake, but you can't PLAY it like Quake and expect to get very far. Instead, you have to exploit the intentionally stupid AI and funnel enemies into killzones, making it feel more like Half-Life, only considerably less forgiving. You also have to reload, which if nothing else requires you to be a bit pickier with your shots. I am forced to lump STRAFE in the same category of roguelikes as CTHON, Sublevel Zero and Enter the Gungeon, where punishing difficulty is supposed to be an advertised feature instead of a drawback. It's a little more fair then Gungeon, though. I have to go once again on record that I don't dislike hard games outright: Bloodborne, Devil May Cry and of course, Quake are among my favorite games. but I don't believe in using difficulty in place of content, and I think STRAFE suffers from that a bit. You should absolutely give it a try you're at all curious, as it's still an infinitely better purchase then any ""Triple A"" shooters. I just think it could have used some kind of progression system a la UNLOVED or Immortal Redneck, which, I admit, might sound blasphemous to a fan of 90s shooters or 90s games in general. Or at least a difficulty selector. I mean, Quake had one of those.",64,5.3

Unlike most other first person shooters, the purpose of System Shock was not to kill everything in sight; nor was it a ""find the key to move onto the next level"" game. The plot was always present, but not so confining as in traditional shooters - there was almost always more than one task to accomplish.

Enemies drop xp which allows you to pick one of 3 upgrades... all of which you’ll have by the end of the game, but these upgrades can give you health by doing damage, it can make the xp drops and coins magnetic to your, make enemies drop pickups... all the way to the max level of 21 which is easily reached before the games end…these item drops are useful in combat and range from health pickups, invincibility potions, and bombs..There are moments you can skip over enemies and some moments where you’ll have to defeat enemies in an area to move on, and you’ll basically be throwing switches, pulling levels... searching for cupcakes to turn in for a random cosmetic item, searching for sticker packs, and collecting cash to unlock chests throughout levels that also contain consumable items and you can buy these items at shopsall of this looks and sounds great.. And at first it actually is great...The gameplay is smooth and fluent... the combat is engaging, you’ll have to dodge spongier enemies... you’ll later have to deal with enemies that heal during battle and some that have ranged attacks..However unfortunately all 9 hours of this game feels exactly the sameAnd that could come down to the nature of these types of games where the platforming is a mix of vertical and horizontal, it’s much harder to tell a story and change things up in every level like a Mario game does for example.. And this game suffers by this fact...there are a few neat moments here with its switches and simple puzzles... but these moments are so rare…The only change up is that each of the world end in a super simple boss battle to take you to a new world and complete another 25 mini levels that all feel the same..They tried… there’s new enemies and picks ups as the game goes on... there’s even a water world…But nothing mixes the gameplay up enough…The Adventure Pals is an enjoyable and cute looking game.. But it’s a monotonous game that overstays its welcome.I give the adventure palsA 6.5/10",78,7

273,The Original Strife: Veteran Edition,12-Dec-14,"When I was little, I played every action game I could get my hands on. However, there was one particular game that always stuck with me: Strife. The last commercial release to use the Doom engine, Strife mystified me with gameplay elements I had personally never seen before. Before Strife, everything had been a boomfest: Kiloblaster. Death Rally. Realms of Chaos. Doom, Heretic, Quake. All action, no **** Not that that was ever a bad thing. Where Doom set a space marine against demon hordes and Quake against lovecraftian horrors, Strife took a different route, blending a medieval world of tunics, crossbows and stone castles with an invading dark future of computers, killer cyborgs and energy rifles. You are a mercenary, just arrived to the small town of Tarnhill, caught in a struggle for power between the oppressive, fanatical Order and the resistance fighters of the Front- a recipe for violence, and to be sure, Strife does not shirk on big, tough fights against multiple foes, with the fast player movement and diverse range of weapons you'd expect from a 90s FPS. But Strife also had something different from other id tech games: Dialogue. It had characters with full voice-acting, a story of betrayal and ancient conspiracy, a sultry-voiced lady with a radio guiding you on your way, a hub-level system that let you revisit previous areas (I didn't play Hexen until years after the fact), hand-drawn portraits and cutscenes, an inventory system a la Heretic, shops, two branching story routes and three endings, and even a rudimentary leveling system. I did not know it at the time, and even then, I had only played the demo, but Strife was the beginning of a lifelong love of the FPS/RPG hybrid. It may have been the first RPG I ever played period- or least the first one I enjoyed (I'm looking at you, Lands of Lore.) Sadly, the studio that created Strife closed, the source code was lost, and game was entirely out of print for almost 20 years, an unjust fate for such a gem. However, late in 2014, this ""Veteran"" edition of the game was released, and at last I was given a chance to experience Strife as it had been intended, and with yet more to offer. I would call this version the definitive edition- not only is the original game restored in its entirety, but the demo version is included as a seperate episode (with deferring dialogue and character placement from the final version), the multiplayer mode cut from the original release has been included, and there is an entire extra secret level, designed by a guy who created one of the reverse-engineered source ports and was instrumental in the release of this version. Also present are three ""talisman"" items, cut from the original release, that if gathered grant the player berserk power comparable to the powerup in Doom, turning your feeble punch-dagger into a weapon capable of destroying Inquisitors, a rare, powerful enemy that serves as a miniboss, in one or two punches. Also mercifully included are objective indicators on your map, which will certainly be a mercy to any first-time Strife players, as some of the later areas of the game are as convoluted as any Doom level. If you ever thought Doom and its derivatives were lacking a certain something, that maybe you wanted a more cinematic experience but with that same fast, frenetic combat, then Strife might be what you're looking for. Just remember... Trust No One.",No Score,8.1
